made for people whom can't rate animes correctly like [me][1].

---
## Requierments
- Python 3.9
- PyQt5, PyQt5-tools and requests modules
- a pc
---
## Features
- After long hours of choosing creates a JSON file with anime organized from best to worst
- that's it
---
## setup
1. install the required modules by using the commands
    ```cmd
    pip install PyQt5
    pip install PyQt5-tools
    pip install requests
    ```
2. run the script made by [Jacekun][2] called [AniPy][3]
3. run my script and select the JSON file made by AniPy
---

This is a quite useless script made for me because I just can't rate animes objectively
If by chance this helps you feel free to do whatever you want to it

A big thanks to Jacekun that saved me a lot of time by making his script.
